1. Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

from datetime import date
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
name = input("What is your name? ")
currYear = date.today().year
print("Dear " + name + "you will be in " + str(currYear -age + 100) + " years 100 years old")

2. Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. 

yourNumber = int(input("Please give any number: "))
if yourNumber % 2 == 0:
    print(str(yourNumber) + " is an even number")
  else: print(str(yourNumber) + " is an odd number")

3. Take a list, say for example this one:
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

elements = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
for element in elements:
    if element < 5:
        print(element)

4. Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

yourNumber = int(input("Please give any positive integer: "))
for i in range (1, yourNumber+1):
    if yourNumber % i == 0:
        print(i)
        
5. Take two lists, say for example these two:
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
for el in a:
    if el in b:
        print(el)
