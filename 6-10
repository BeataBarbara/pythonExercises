6. Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

  yourString = str(input("Please input a word: "))
  antiWord= yourString[::-1]
  print(antiWord)
  if yourString == antiWord:
      print(yourString + " is a palindrome")
  else:
      print(yourString + " is not a palindrome")
    
    
7. Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

  elements = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
  newElements = []
  for element in elements:
      if element % 2 == 0:
          newElements.append(element)
  print(newElements)
  
 8. Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)
 
   import random

  elements = ["rock",  "paper", "scissors"]
  myStr = "select from a list: "
  decision = "play"

  while decision == "play":
      yourElement = ""
      autoElement = random.choice(elements)

      while not(yourElement in elements):
          yourElement = input(myStr + ', '.join(elements) + ": ")

      print("You play against " + autoElement)    
      if yourElement == autoElement:
          print("There is no winner")
      if yourElement == elements[0]:
          if autoElement == elements[1]:
              print("looser!")
          if autoElement == elements[2]:
              print("congrats, you're winner")

      if yourElement == elements[1]:
          if autoElement == elements[2]:
              print("looser!")
          if autoElement == elements[0]:
              print("congrats, you're winner")

      if yourElement == elements[2]:
          if autoElement == elements[0]:
              print("looser!")
          if autoElement == elements[1]:
              print("congrats, you're winner")

      decision = input("Do you want to play again? If yes, type <<play>>: ").lower()

9. Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise)

  import random

  myNumber = -1
  aNumber = random.randint(1,9)
  print(aNumber)
  while not(aNumber==myNumber):
      myNumber = int(input("Please select a number from range (1,9) incl.: "))
      if aNumber == myNumber:
          print("Congrats")
      elif aNumber > myNumber:
          print("your number is too low")
      else:
          print("your number is too hight") 
          
10.  This week’s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5), except require the solution in a different way.
Take two lists, say for example these two:
	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. 

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  a=list(dict.fromkeys(a))
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
  b=list(dict.fromkeys(b))

  for el in a:
      if el in b:
          print(el)
